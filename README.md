# healthy-food-link
User will be able to find and locate natural health/organic food stores, restaurants, supermarkets, local food growers/farmers based on geo-locations.

#General Project Idea/ Summary
User will be able to find and locate natural health/organic food stores, restaurants, supermarkets, local food growers/farmers based on geo-locations. The site will use API or other data sources. The site will display a list of the closest results and give the user the option to generate driving directions to a selected result. We also plan to expand functionality to allow local natural food growers to register and connect/sell directly to local buyers.
